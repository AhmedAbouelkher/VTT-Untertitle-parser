# VTT Untertitle parser

I am learning German ðŸ˜ƒ. this is a handy tool to parse the untertitles of the movies and series that I watch and translate them to English.

## How to use it?

- Clone the repository
- run `go mod tidy`
- run `go run main.go -src <SOURCE_LANGUAGE> -dst <DESTINATION_LANGUAGE> <LOCAL_FILE_PATH>`
- You will find a new file with the same name but starts with `translated_` in the same directory as the original file.

### Example

```shell
go run main.go -src "de" -dst "en" ./data/untertitles.vtt
```
